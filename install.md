# Installation

We are in the prerelease stage, so at the moment, the PyPI repository 
doesn't contain the package. In the future, installation should be as easy as writing "pip install shfl".

Currently, the best option is install the package in editable mode, linking the package to the source code. 
From the main directory of the project, you can write: 

```shell
pip install -e .
```

The project documentation is mainly autogenerated from pydocs. If you want to generate the documentation, just go to the
documentation directory and execute:


```shell
python autogen.py
```

The documentation is created using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). If you want to see the web version of the 
documentation, you can serve after installing it within the documentation directory:

```shell
mkdocs serve
```
